              PRINTF GROUP PROJECT

A printf project repository for our group.

The printf()function prints output to stdout,according to format and other arguments passed to printf().The string format consists of two types of items - characters that will be printed to the screen,and format commands that define how the other arguments to printf() are displayed.Basically,you specify a format string that has text in it,as well as "special" characters that map to the other arguments of printf().
* the prototype the function is: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
write output to stdout, the standard output stream
format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
c
s
%

* /* * The Header is optional and allows you to compare the * custom _printf() function to the standard library one. */ #include <stdio.h> ` #include <limits.h> #include <stdio.h> #include "main.h"

thats all for our in our project.
